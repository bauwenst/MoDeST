        Doing a recursive concatenation became too difficult, so here's a different approach: assume the leaves (which
        are all morphemes) are the final splits. If a leaf is an affix, then it requires its relevant *sibling* to merge
        itself all the way up to that level, no matter how deep it goes.

        You call this method at the top level. The children at that level are superior to the ones at all lower levels;
        it doesn't matter if you have a derivation inside a derivation, because the former will be merged immediately by
        the latter and hence you don't even have to check for it.
        It also means you don't have to be afraid of putting a space left of a prefix, because there can never be another
        prefix to its left (because in that case, that prefix would never allow you to be deciding about that).

    def segment(self) -> Tuple[str, ...]:
        """
        Splits into morphs rather than morphemes. That is: removing spaces from the result will produce the lemma.
        For the lemma "kolencentrale":
            morphemeSplit: kool en centrum aal e
            morphSplit:    kol en centr al e

        There are two ways to do this: greedily and optimally. Both assume the following word formation process from a
        list (not a set) of morphemes:
            1. For each morpheme, keep it or drop it.
            2. For each kept morpheme, truncate any amount of characters FROM THE END.
            3. Starting from an empty string, alternate between generating random characters and concatenating the next morpheme.
        Dropping morphemes happens surprisingly often (e.g. isolementspositie -> isoleer ement s pose eer itie).

        The most simplifying assumption in this approach is how a morpheme can express itself:
            1. It is a contiguous substring of the morpheme,
            2. if it appears, the first letter is guaranteed,
            3. after the first character mismatch in the string, the rest of the morpheme has no impact whatsoever.

        The goal is now to, given a list of morphemes and the concatenation of the morphs (the lemma), segment back into
        morphs. That is: given a string and a list of strings of which any prefix could be in the first string, find a
        new list of strings which all have a prefix that is also a prefix of a string in the other list, in the same
        order, and whose concatenation is the full string.

        There are two ways to implement this.
            - The greedy approach: for each morpheme, find its biggest prefix that also prefixes the current position
              in the string, and move there. If that prefix has length 0, move over a character, and retry. If you can't
              find any non-zero prefix this way, drop the morpheme and retry the process for the next morpheme.
            - The optimal approach: find the sequence of substrings for which each substring has a prefix matching one
              that of one of the morphemes, the matches are in order, and the sum of character overlaps is maximal.

        All this has to tolerate uppercase lemmas with lowercase morphemes, uppercase morphemes, accented lemmas,
        and hyphenated lemmas.
            - ((andromeda)[N],(nevel)[N])[N]                     Andromedanevel
            - ((Cartesiaan)[N],(s)[A|N.])[A]                     Cartesiaans
            - ((elegant)[A],(nce)[N|A.])[N]                      élégance
            - (((centrum)[N],(aal)[A|N.])[A],(Aziatisch)[A])[A]  centraal-Aziatisch

        For hyphenation, if the hyphen isn't surrounded by characters of the same morph, it is split off by this method.
        Note that this means that the output of this method cannot be aligned with the morpheme list, because there is
        no morpheme for the hyphen. See _morphSplit() for the raw, alignable split.
