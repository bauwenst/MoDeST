        MorphyNet's derivational decompositions have a strange loss of information
        where they give the affix and ONE OF the other morphemes, but not always all
        the morphemes, and nothing is ordered. That means you have to figure out
        which part of the word is the affix, which part is the given morpheme, and
        which is the rest, before you can even align them. It gives a flag "prefix"
        or "suffix", yet there are also interfices in the dataset...

        You also can't deduce the full morpheme sequence from the inflectional
        MorphyNet dataset of the same language, because they don't overlap in their
        words. (E.g.: Wiederverwendbarkeit is in German MorphyNet derivations but
        not inflections.)
