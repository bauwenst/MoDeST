"""
A kernel in MoDeST is a class that reads a file or folder of files with exactly one storage and tag format.
A dataset provides a unified interface overtop one or more kernels.

The reason for separating these two concepts is so that when composing two datasets, the default assumption is that
the datasets themselves already work with multiple formats and thus no extra complexity is introduced by suddenly
having more than one thing rather than one thing to iterate internally.

    Manages all writes of raw versions of morphological objects to a file or folder.
    The output path is only known after construction.

    There are two ways to implement this:
        1. Using Python's 'with' context manager.
        2. With a generator coroutine, i.e. a single method
            def openStream(out_path: Path) -> Generator[None, Raw, None]:
                ...
        which handles its own setup (rather than having to implement an __enter__ and __exit__)
        and has to use a line like 'next_example = yield' which receives examples from .send().

    The first is difficult to implement but easy to use:

        with Writer(out_path) as writer:
            for raw in iterator:
                writer.write(raw)

    The second is easy to implement but difficult to use (i.e. you need to know more):

        stream = Writer().openStream(out_path)
        for raw in iterator:
            stream.send(raw)
        stream.close()

    But since we are the user and we hide this usage below caching methods, I will go for the easier implementation.
