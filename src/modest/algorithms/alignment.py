def alignMorphemes_Greedy(word: str, morphemes: str) -> str:
    """
    The greedy approach sometimes outputs the wrong split, namely when a morpheme's tail looks like the next morpheme.
    An example is "élégance -> ((elegant)[A],(nce)[N|A.])[N]", where the "n" in "élégance" supposedly does not come
    from the first morpheme but from the second. The greedy approach first finds "élégan" as the first morpheme's
    match, and then cannot find the morpheme "nce" in the remainder "ce".
    e-Lex contains 2848 such cases. Some other examples:
        acceptatiegraad   ---> accept eer atie graad    ---> acceptati egr aad
        academievriend    ---> academisch ie vriend     ---> academievr iend
        protestantsgezind ---> protest eer ant s gezind ---> protestantsg ezind
    To clarify: in the last example, it finds "protestant". Then it tries to find any prefix of "eer", and indeed,
    it finds an "e", but only later on. That means the letters between protestant and e, "sg", are stuck to the former.
    Then it tries to find the remaining morphemes and finds none of them, so it sticks the rest to that e.

    Can you always detect that greedy has made this mistake by counting morphs? No. There will be both false positives
    but also false negatives.
        False positive: isoleer ement s pose eer itie  has morphemes that disappear in  isole ment s pos itie
        False negative: A BC C D  accidentally subsumes the first C of  A BCE C D  in the BC morpheme, and matches it with the second. This is clearly unintended.

    """
    Iterative Viterbi algorithm with the same optimal results as a recursive bruteforce, except the problem goes
    from completely intractable (several minutes, running out of memory) to trivial (0 seconds and a small table).

    Viterbi is NOT as simple as e.g. in the BBPE paper for decoding bad UTF-8. The reason is that the allowed
    vocabulary (the set of steps to new nodes) CHANGES depending on which steps have been made on the path to a
    node, meaning you can't be sure which solution is optimal up to that node without knowing what happens after.

    Here's how I re-interpreted the problem to Viterbi: instead of a substring by itself being a node in
    the search graph, a node is a pair of (substring, available vocab), where 'available vocab' is the start of the
    sublist of morphemes remaining, out of all morphemes available.
