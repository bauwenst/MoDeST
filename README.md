# MoDeST: a Morphological Decomposition &amp; Segmentation Trove
The point of MoDeST is two-fold:
1. Provide a general object-oriented Python interface to access morphological decompositions and segmentations;
2. Host morphological datasets generated by smaller research groups that would otherwise have a hard time being found.

*Morphological decomposition* is the task of recognising which building blocks a word was originally constructed from. These building blocks are its *morphemes*.
As an example, the Dutch derivation `isometrisch` ("isometric") can be decomposed into the morphemes `iso`, `meter` and `isch`.

*Morphological segmentation* is the task of isolating the substrings of a word that correspond to its morphemes. These substrings are called *morphs*.
In the above example, the segmentation would be `iso/metr/ic`.
