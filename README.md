# MoDeST: a Morphological Decomposition &amp; Segmentation Trove
The point of MoDeST is two-fold:
1. Provide a general object-oriented Python interface to access morphological decompositions and segmentations;
2. Host morphological datasets generated by smaller research groups that would otherwise have a hard time being found.

*Morphological decomposition* is the task of recognising which building blocks a word was originally constructed from. These building blocks are its *morphemes*.
As an example, the Dutch derivation `isometrisch` ("isometric") can be decomposed into the morphemes `iso`, `meter` and `isch`.

*Morphological segmentation* is the task of isolating the substrings of a word that correspond to its morphemes. These substrings are called *morphs*.
In the above example, the segmentation would be `iso/metr/ic`.

## Installation
Run
```shell
pip install "modest[github] @ git+https://github.com/bauwenst/MoDeST.git"
```

## Repo layout
Currently, the repo looks as follows:
```
data/              ---> Datasets hosted specifically by MoDeST on GitHub. Will NOT be downloaded when you install the package.
src/modest/        ---> All source code for the Python package that will be installed in your interpreter.
    datasets/      ---> Per-language definitions of the classes users will interact with.
    downloaders/   ---> Support code for pulling in remote data.
    formats/       ---> Support code for interpreting file formats by specific authors/organisations.
    interfaces/    ---> Declarations of the interfaces users will interact with.
```

Currently, every language has its own subpackage under `datasets/`. The assumption is that every language may have multiple
datasets and that every dataset may need more than a single class definition to work (even if most of the support code should
be under `formats/`). If this turns out not to be the case in the future, we might go from `datasets/{language}/{dataset}.py`
to instead `datasets/{language}.py` for simplicity of imports.
