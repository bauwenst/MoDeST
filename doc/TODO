TODO:
    - MorphyNet has entries that have just - which is apparently a code for "same as lemma" https://github.com/kbatsuren/MorphyNet/issues/7
        - For Spanish and Italian, these are actually quite interesting cases. They are words like infinitives and the masculine singular of adjectives and participles.
          That is: words that very clearly have bound morphemes, but the only way you could know about these morphemes is
          to look at the next word's decomposition and steal the decomposition from there.
          You would want to do this at download time.
          Example:
                cargar	cargar	V;NFIN	-
                cargar	cargando	V|V.CVB;PRS	cargar|ando
                preservado	preservado	ADJ;MASC;SG	-
                preservado	preservada	ADJ|FEM;SG	preservado|a
          should become
                cargar	cargar	V;NFIN	cargar|ar
                cargar	cargando	V|V.CVB;PRS	cargar|ando
                preservado	preservado	ADJ;MASC;SG	preservado|o
                preservado	preservada	ADJ|FEM;SG	preservado|a
          ...which you could probably achieve as follows:
            1. Let Viterbi find the morph corresponding to the last morpheme of the next word.
            2. Trim that from that word to reveal a stem.
            3. Assert that the first word is prefixed by this stem.
            4. Let the first word's suffix is whatever is after that stem.
    - Add the following datasets:
        - LADEC: https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/dc3b9033-14d0-48d7-b6fa-6398a30e61e4
        - MorphoLex: https://github.com/hugomailhot/MorphoLex-en/blob/master/MorphoLEX_en.xlsx
        - DagoBERT: https://cistern.cis.lmu.de/dagobert/
    - CELEX probably needs some reduction of duplicates that only differ in PoS tags but show the same exact segmentations.
